## Introduction
Welcome to my **Sales Analysis Project**. 
This project covers three branches scattered across three regions of operations. It is a prescriptive and diagnostic analysis in which Microsoft Excel was used in cleaning and analysing, while Microsoft Powerpoint was used for its presentation.
## Objective
* Understanding sales behaviour across all branches
* Discover peak period and top selling product
* Analyse and understand regional performance

## Data Preparation & Modelling
The dataset has eighteen (18) columns and one thousand (1,000) rows. Since this is an Excel project, the raw data was cleaned, transformed and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Calculations, formulars, pivot tables, pivot charts, conditional formattingbwere used in getting the final dashboard. Analysis includes;
* Time with the most profit
* Total order by branch vs profit made
* Business value by gender
* Unit sold per month
* Quantity sold vs gross profit made
* Customer semantic analysis
* Unit sold per product
* Monthly revenue, e.t.c

## Analysis findings
The following were findings gathered from the analysis of the dataset which we propose should help the business make concrete decision for better profit across the three regions.
* The total revenue across the three regions was three hundred and twenty-two thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six dollars, seventy-five cents ($322,966.75), while profit grossed was fifteen thousand, three hundred and seventy-nine dollars, thirty-seven cents ($15,379.37). All of which came from selling five thousand, five hundred and ten (5,510) items from one thousand (1,000) orders fulfilled.
* The branch in Yangon had the highest amount of orders placed, and quantity sold, however this did not translate to the highest revenue or sale as that was clinched by the branch at Naypyitaw.
* In January, **sports & travel** was the collective top selling category across the branches. February was food and beverage, while March was Home and lifestyle
